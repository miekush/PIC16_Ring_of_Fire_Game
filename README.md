# Project Description

The device uses a PIC16F15223 8-bit microcontroller to drive a ring of 1206 LEDs. A low cost tactile switch starts and stops the led chaser and allows for switching between game mode and a speed settings mode depending on the press duration. Programming the device is completed via the onboard Tag-Connect footprint.

# Breadboard Prototype

# Enclosure

To make the device more comfortable for handheld use, I designed a small enclosure which can be easily 3D printed for a more professional device appearence.
